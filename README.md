uwaterloo-calendar
==================

Export your UW calendar to iCal.

iCal calendars seem to work with most things. Most notably Outlook, Google calendar, and iCal.

The code is quite shitty and could use a refactoring, which I plan to do sometime soon.

There is no front-end as of yet, so if you need to use this thing, get in touch, and I'll either whip out a simple front-end, or I'll tell you how to use the API.

###TODO

- Refactor
- Make it fetch everything in bulk and store locally so we don't hit our API limit
- Front-end
